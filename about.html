    <p> <h3>Early Technical Experience</h3><br>

My journey into the world of technology began during my school years, where I first explored software development through a project to create a <span class="glow-once"><b>JEE Question Paper Management System</b></span>. This experience introduced me to the fundamentals of programming and project design, sparking a deeper interest in solving real-world problems through technology.<br>

In addition to software, I was an active member of the <span class="glow-once"><b>Robotics Club</b></span>, where I had the opportunity to work on hands-on hardware projects. One of the most impactful was a <span class="glow-once"><b>Trespassing Prevention System</b></span> for Defence—a fully functional, hand-crafted prototype designed with my team to address border security concerns. This project not only deepened my understanding of robotics and sensor-based systems but also taught me the importance of teamwork, innovation, and practical application of theoretical knowledge.
